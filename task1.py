# Program to find the area of a triangle

# enter base and height
base = float(input("base of the triangle: "))
height = float(input(": height of the triangle"))

# Calculation of area
#Area=0.5×base×height (0.5 is like saying a half 1/2 but in python 1/2 is written as 0.5)
area = 0.5 * base * height

print("The area of the triangle is:", area)
